    **Jungjoon Park - Research Scientist in Brain-Inspired AI & AGI**

    I am a research scientist with over 15 years of full-stack neuroscience experience, holding a Ph.D. in Bio and Brain Engineering from KAIST. 
    My work has spanned across human, non-human primate, and rodent studies, focusing on behavioral, genetic, electrophysiological, and computational analyses of empathy, social memory, and fear responses.
        

    **Education & Academic Background**
    - **B.S. (2005-2010):** Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST.
    - **M.S. (2010-2013):** Focused on the investigation of empathy in terms of age and memory.
    - **Ph.D. (2013-2022):** Conducted an in-depth study on the behavioral and genetic factors influencing observational fear learning and empathy.

    **Neuroscience Research Experience**
    - **2011-2012:** Trainee at KIST, where I honed my early research skills.
    - **2012-2021:** Researcher at IBS and KIST, contributing to large-scale studies published in top journals.
    - Led projects involving single-unit recordings, fMRI, EEG, and advanced behavioral analytics.

    **Startup & Leadership Roles**
    - **2022-Present:** Co-founder, COO & Research Director at ACTNOVA.
      - Spearheaded the development of animal behavior analysis services for institutions such as MIT, Broad Institute, KAIST, and UCSD.
      - Developed innovative hardware and AI-driven analysis platforms, earning accolades like the 2022 CES Innovation Award for the AVATAR project.

    **AI & Machine Learning Projects**
    - Currently engaged in the 2024-25 Neuromatch Academy Deep Learning Impact Scholars Program, preparing a micro-publication on prompt strategies in emotion recognition.
    - Led multiple projects integrating ML techniques (from tabular data analysis and regression to document classification, summarization using LLMs, RAG, and MLOps) with neuroscience research.
    - Founded the KAIST NeuroAI academic group to foster research discussions on brain-inspired AI.

    **Research Projects & Grants**
    - Directed and contributed to government-funded projects including:
      - EEG-fMRI based lie detection system (2022).
      - Multi-scale modeling of instinctual behavior (2021-2022).
      - Studies on the influence of social context on fear empathy (2019-2022).

    **Vision & Future Directions**
    My overarching goal is to bridge the gap between neuroscience and artificial general intelligence (AGI) by leveraging brain-inspired approaches to develop more adaptive and intuitive machine learning models. I continuously seek to challenge conventional paradigms and foster interdisciplinary collaboration to propel both fields forward.

    I welcome questions and discussions on how my diverse background in neuroscience, startup leadership, and advanced AI research can contribute to pioneering research in AGI and brain-inspired AI.
