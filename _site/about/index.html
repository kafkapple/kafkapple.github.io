<h2 id="vision--future-directions"><strong>Vision &amp; Future Directions</strong></h2>
<p>My overarching goal is to bridge the gap between neuroscience and artificial general intelligence (AGI) by leveraging brain-inspired approaches to develop more adaptive and intuitive machine learning models. I continuously seek to challenge conventional paradigms and foster interdisciplinary collaboration to propel both fields forward.</p>

<p>I welcome questions and discussions on how my diverse background in neuroscience, startup leadership, and advanced AI research can contribute to pioneering research in AGI and brain-inspired AI.</p>
